## About

In Fall 2025 I will be joining the [Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics](https://www.itmat.upenn.edu) as a postdoctoral fellow with Gregory Grant and Shaon Sengupta working in bioinformatics and chronobiology.

I completed my mathematics PhD in May 2025 with [Florian Pop](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~pop/). My mathematical interests are broadly in Galois theory and number theory. Before that, I was an undergraduate at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/math). My CV is [here](/assets/CV.pdf).
