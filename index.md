## About

I am a sixth-year graduate student at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.math.upenn.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Florian Pop](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~pop/). My interests are broadly in Galois theory and model-theoretic algebra. Before Penn, I was an undergraduate at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/math). My CV is [here](/assets/CV.pdf).

I am on the job market for Fall 2025!
