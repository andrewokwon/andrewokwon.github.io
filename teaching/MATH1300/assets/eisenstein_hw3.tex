\begin{enumerate}
	\item There was a small arithmetic error in part (b), should be $\frac{2}{\sqrt{21}}$.
	\item Good!
	\item In the last equation, since $\cot(\operatorname{arccot}(x)) = x$, may as well write the derivative as $\frac{-1}{x^{2} + 1}$, which is much simpler.
	\item Make sure you keep track that the derivative is negative! $- \frac{(\sqrt{96})}{2} (2)$ is correct, but $4 \sqrt{6}$ after needs a minus sign.
	\item (1/2) For (b), $f'$ should be evaluated at $2025$, not $45$. (2025 is the $x$-coordinate, 45 is the $y$-coordinate.) Then, the slope is $\frac{1}{90}$, and the approximation we get is $45 - \frac{2}{90} = 45 - \frac{1}{45} = \frac{2024}{45}$.
	\item (1/2) Correctly found that $y = 1/2$ is a critical point, not sure where $y=0.75$ came from\ldots When $y=1/2$, the area is $-3 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{-1}{2} = \frac{3}{4}$, and this is the maximum.
	\item (1/2) Part (d) is possible; consider $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$.
	\item Good!
	\item Good!
