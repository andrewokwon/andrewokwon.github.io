## Resources

There are many good resources for this course; below are just a few that I've become familiar with.

* [Nakia Rimmer's Math 103 course](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~rimmer/math103/) : These include previous lecture slides, homework assignments, practice exams, and videos covering specific topics/examples.
* [Paul's Online Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calci/calci.aspx) : A comprehensive set of course notes that start from the basics and provide plenty of examples and practice problems. (All practice problems should have detailed solutions.)
* [Lyryx Calculus for Social Sciences](https://www.sfu.ca/math-coursenotes/Math%20157%20Course%20Notes/book-1.html) : A solid introduction to differential calculus with a peek towards multivariable calculus at the end. This covers slightly different material than what we will, but we are basically on the same track up until chapter 5. (Nearly all exercises have solutions.)
* [James Stewart's Calculus: Early Transcendentals](https://franklin.library.upenn.edu/catalog/FRANKLIN_9941296343503681) : This should be available through the Penn Library (see the link). This has become a popular choice over the years, and is an option for anybody who prefers a physical textbook. 

There are also other great resources that adhere less closely to a standard course but have a plethora of interesting examples and applications.

* [3Blue1Brown's Essence of calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) : A free course offering the core concept of Calculus, with a visuals-first approach aimed at making you feel like you could have discovered the subject yourself. (I highly recommend all of his other videos as well.)
* [Rob Ghrist's Calculus GREEN](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8erL0pXF3JaFSMdokheNMvTa96jdc4GU) : A suite of single variable Calculus videos designed for students who have seen some basic calculus and want to learn at a deeper level.
