## About

I am a second-year graduate student at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.math.upenn.edu/) generously supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). My interests are broadly in algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry. Before Penn, I was an undergraduate at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/math). My CV is [here](/assets/CV.pdf).
